## Wiring

The HX711 is a 24bit analog to digital converter.  Arduino load cell
applications typically use the HX711 to convert analog stress guage
resistance measurements to digital readings.  These 24 bit readings
are fed to the Arduino using the SPI protocol.  Data bits are read
over the DT lead on pin 2 of the arduino for each toggle of the SCK
clock lead on pin 3. See also [HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Interface with Arduino](https://circuits4you.com/2016/11/25/hx711-arduino-load-cell/).

This is the pinout wiring used by the HX711 sketch stored at:
`../../src/hx711_sketch/hx711_sketch.ino`


The Arduino standard Firmata library doesn't have direct support for
SPI.  So as a work-around, this sketch uses [this HX711
library](https://github.com/bogde/HX711) to read the 24 bit ADC values
from the HX711 board.  

Readings are transmitted using Firmata back to the controlling host.  These are sent over a serial usb port encoded as a 4-character Sysex strings.  See also [Sysex Message Format](http://firmata.org/wiki/V2.2ProtocolDetails)  

## Configuration
This libary looks for a serial port with `usbmodem` in the name. This
appears to be the convention on MacOS.

``` shell
ls /dev/ | grep usb
```
See `find-arduino-ports`. 

## Usage

Use `start!` to connect to the serial port and take n number of
readings from the HX711, for example 500.

``` clojure
(start! 500)
```

You can use `get-next` to retrieve the most recent stable reading from
the measurement `*channel*` It returns the raw ADC measurement and a
calibrated weight.

``` clojure
(get-next) => {:raw 268219035, :weight 25.0}
```

## Calibration
There are two steps to calibrate the scale.  First step is compute a
`tare` value, and then compute a scaling factor.

Tare represents the baseline, zero level, value. After setting this,
the scale should report a zero weight whenever the scale is unloaded.

Use the `tare!` function to zero the scale.  This works by averaging
all of the latest readings in `queue`.  The number of readings depends
on the `queue-depth` parameter and the length of time you have been
collecting measurements. The queue-depth size is 10 by default. 

The scale needs to be unloaded while these 10 measurements are
collected. 

You can also set this value directly, ignoring whatever measurements
may have been collected.

``` clojure
(tare! 268207711)
```

The second step is to compute the scaling factor.  This maps real
world units, such as grams, to the equivalent raw ADC value range.

Place a known weight on the scale, wait for the measurement readings
to stabilize, then use `calibrate!` to set the scaling factor.
`calibrate!` uses 25g as the default reference weight.  This happens
to be the weight of the original small 5V, 1A Apple Phone usb
chargers.  You can override this with whatever reference weight value
you choose.  For example, calibrate using a 10.5 gram weight.

``` clojure
(calibrate! 10.5)
```

## Noise

Readings will fluctuate even when the scale is unloaded.  Typically
within a +/- 0.1 gram range.  Some of the variation could potentially
be avoided by using a dedicated regulated 5V power source for the
HX711 board.  But [there are other factors](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=365107.0).

New stable weight measurements are pushed to a core-async channel called
`*channel*`, which can be read using `get-next`.

Noise detection plays a role in determining what messages to consider
as new values as opposed to random variation. This uses the
`trend-analytics` function to compute several metrics:

* `:bias` sum of the deltas between the last n (queue-depth) readings
* `:mnv`  most negative difference between adjacent reading pairs
* `:mxv`  most postiive difference between adjacent reading pairs
* `:segs` 2 paritioned segments of the last n readings
* `:t0`   average reading value for oldest readings (first segment)
* `:t1`   average reading value for most recent readings
* `:dir`  trendline direction (:stable, :inc, :dec, or :noise)

Trendline direction `:dir` is used to indicate the direction readings
are heading.  The `noise-level` parameter specifies the +/- cutoff
threshold for determining if the most recently recorded values are too
noisy to be trusted.  A threshold value 80 seems to work well in my
experiments.  This value is compared against the most negative and
most positive difference between adjacent pairs of reading.  The
values for these variances are recorded in the `:mnv` and `:mxv`
elements of the analytics map. Readings are classified as `:noise`
when either of these variances fall outside the noise-level threshold.

The trendline direction is determined by comparing the average value
of the most recent half of the reading queue, `:t1` to the average
value of the oldest half `:t0`.  Upward and downward trends are
indicated when the difference between these values falls above or
below the `:noise-threshold` parameter.  Otherwise the measurement is
indicated as stable.

## Stable Measurements
The `measurement-handler` uses `trend-analytics` to detect new
measurements to post to the measurement `*channel*`.  This is the
intended interface point for other applications. This is a sliding
buffer of size 1 that can be accessed via the `get-next` function.

This function will return an empty hash-map if no new stable readings
are detected within a specified period of time.  By default this
timeout is 500 msecs.  Otherwise it returns the most recently observed
stable reading that includes the raw HX711 integer value and the
computed calibrated weight.  Weight units are whatever you used to
calibrate your scale.

``` clojure
(get-next 1000) => {}
(get-next 1000) => {:raw 268219035, :weight 25.0}
```
